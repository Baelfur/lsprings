# lsprings

A very simple map app. Static page served by GitHub Pages, data prepared by Python.

## How it works

GitHub Pages only serves static files — no Python runs at request time. So:

- **`index.html`** — the whole UI. Leaflet + OpenStreetMap tiles, loaded from a CDN. No build step, no framework.
- **`scripts/build_data.py`** — standard library only. Reads `data/points.csv`, writes `points.json`.
- **`points.json`** — what the page fetches at load time. Committed, so Pages can serve it.

## Adding points

Edit `data/points.csv`, then regenerate:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_data.py
```

Commit both the CSV and the regenerated `points.json`.

## Running locally

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 — a plain `file://` open will not work, because the page fetches `points.json`.

## Dependencies

None to install. Python 3 standard library; Leaflet from CDN.
